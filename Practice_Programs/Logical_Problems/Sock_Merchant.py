# "Given a list of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching
# colors are there. For example, there are 7 socks with colors [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]. There is one pair of color 1 and
# one of color 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.
# Create a function that returns an integer representing the number of matching pairs of socks that are available.
